* Copy `GPMDPJson.lua`, `GPMDP.ini` and `JSON.lua` into %HOMEPATH%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Honey\player\ (or your own skins folder)
* Place `true.png` and `false.png` into %HOMEPATH%\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Honey\@Resources\Images\
* Refresh Rainmeter and select GPMDP.ini variant.

Seekbar is no longer working due to lack of WS support in Rainmeter.
